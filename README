 DESCRIPTION
 -----------
    Gusto is an application designed to convert video to individual images. It is possible to convert
    and entire video, a section of a video (seconds or minutes) or selected frames of a video.
    Multiple formats for input and output are provided for.

 INSTALL
 -------

 1. DISTRIBUTION PACKAGE
 -----------------------
    This is probably the easiest and best way for installation.

    Download the latest distribution archive from here: 
    	https://github.com/mr-headwind/Gusto/tree/master/DIST_PACKAGES 
    to your download directory (eg. $HOME/Downloads).

    Start a terminal or xterm session
    cd $HOME/Downloads (or your download directory)
    tar xvzf Gusto-x.xx.tar.gz (where x.xx is the version number)
    ./configure --prefix=/usr
    make
    sudo make install

    The following sections may help if you encounter problems during this process.

 2. DEB PACKAGE
 --------------
    A binary deb package file may be available on SourceForge at:-

	https://sourceforge.net/projects/Gusto/?source=directory

    or go to the SourceForge home page and search for 'Gusto'.

    Download the binary for your environment to your preferred download directory.
    Install the package using your preferred package manager / installer. 
        eg. sudo gdebi Gusto-n.nn_amd64.deb   (you may need:  'sudo apt install gdebi-core' first)
        or  sudo dpkg -i Gusto-n.nn_amd64.deb   followed by  'sudo apt-get install -f'

 DEPENDENCIES
 ------------
    The GTK+ 3.0 libraries need to be installed and, for the most part,
    will likely already be present. However, if there is a problem, try:
    	sudo apt-get build-dep libgtk-3-dev 
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gstreamer-developers/ppa
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install gstreamer1.0*
        sudo apt-get install gstreamer-video-1.0
        sudo apt-get install gstreamer-pbutils-1.0
    
    Additionally the following libraries are required and _MAY_ need installation if 
    dependencies cannot be resolved on installation:-
    	libpthread-stubs0-dev
    	libjpeg-dev
    	libpng-dev

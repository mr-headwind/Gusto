.SH BUGS
Gusto is currently Beta software and is reasonably stable. However bugs may be 
encountered from time to time. Should this happen, please provide details to the 
author. 

There is an occasional error when Gusto is run for the first time in a session 
where the program aborts with a core dump. This appears to be a problem with the 
driver and the camera not being ready. Running again usually works, but the transient 
nature makes this difficult to narrow down.
